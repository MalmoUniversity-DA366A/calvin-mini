Here's how to get started.## Install `pip` and `virtualenv`Check if `pip` is installed:       which pipshould list it. If not, use     sudo easy_install pip    to install it.Next, use `pip` to install `virtualenv`:     sudo pip install virtualenv**N.B.** From now on, _don't use sudo_ with you commands. ## Create a virtual environmentFirst create a location to store your virtual environments (I chose `~/.virtualenvs/`, use that or whatever suits your taste), then create a new virtual environment:    mkdir ~/.virtualenvs/    virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/test-calvinActivate the new `test-calvin` environment    source ~/.virtualenvs/test-calvin/bin/activateand your prompt should change to indicate the activation by prepending `(test-calvin)` to whatever was there before. Use `deactivate` if you should want to leave the virtual environment. A good intro to using virtualenv can be found [here][3]## Installing CalvinGo to a directory of your choice and clone calvin:  git clone git@github.com:EricssonResearch/calvin-base.git  Step into `cavin-base` and use `pip` to install required packages and set up Calvin for development:     pip install -e .A quick check with `which csruntime` should return `~/.virtualenvs/test-calvin/bin/csruntime`. The beauty of `pip install -e .` is that you don't have to re-install calvin every time you change the code or pull update from github. See [this link][4] for more info on `pip` and `pip install -e .` (aka ["Editable Installs"][5]).[1]: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[2]: https://github.com/EricssonResearch/calvin-base[3]: http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/[4]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html[5]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install.html#editable-installs
